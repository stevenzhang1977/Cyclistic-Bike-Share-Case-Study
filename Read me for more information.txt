The link above brings you to my folder on Google Drive that contains Excel Spreadsheets for the analysis.

Due to the file upload size limit, I could not directly upload these .xlsx files onto GitHub.

There are 5 files:

1. Divvy_Trips_2019_Full.xlsx
2. Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.xlsx
3. Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.xlsx
4. Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.xlsx
5. Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.xlsx

Contents of each file:

Divvy_Trips_2019_Full.xlsx
- This is a summary file of the analysis, containing results from every quarter.
- 4 sheets, each containing pivot tables and visualizations of the analysis for each quarter.
